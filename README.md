## Background

Today, artificial intelligence algorithms are adopted in almost every aspect of our life. Machine learning, a branch of AI, is a good start for anyone interested in AI. In all the machine learning courses on the Internet, Machine Learning by Stanford University, taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera, is one of the most popular, because of its amateur-friendly approach to multiple topics in machine learning algorithms, ranging from linear regression to neural network.

However, not everyone could handle all the programming assignments without confronting with any problem. This repository serves as a reference for anyone in need to handle the assignments. It's not recommended to copy the codes without trying to solve the problems on your own.

## Files

In each folder, there is a PDF file providing instruction on the programming assignment as well as a folder containing all the codes necessary to finish the assignment. For simplicity, files related to assignment submission are deleted.
